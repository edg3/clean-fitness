# What is Clean Fitness?
I felt like finally making the revamped version of my own personal fitness and exercise application. This is generally what I feel like using, to be useful, and to get myself back on track with my proper fitness schedules and plans.

# About and Ideas - Android Fitness App
- Personal Exercise Tracking which has notifications as reminders
-- Easily understandable exercise plan built in [see (1) below]
-- Method for categorising with and without weights
-- Tracking and graphs
-- Personal body tracking
-- Method to turn on 'Warm Up' before exercise - gives 5 minutes to Walk, Run, Cycle, Row, etc before the exercise - you can choose what and track it
-- Muscle Grouping most likely helps with usability [see (2) below]
- Personal Calories Tracking with which is meant to build the habit of not constantly eating 'too much'; more an assistant than a hardcore food management system
-- Put in recipes; can track the amounts used; implies can have approximate calories out dishes (e.g. 5th approx for dinner, 5th approx for lunch tomorrow; implies track 'what was made last night' for an 'in the fridge' which you can clean out later)
-- Tracking and graphs; Food Journal - keep track of everything
-- Add in a suggestion system for things like hardcore exercise planning

[Considering: possibly store photos in app DB; might make it a little painful for sharing, though]
[(1) Build in old @Home plan, Build in old RTe plan for @Gym, Build in RTe suggestions and recommendations to understandable suggestions]
[Considering: Mapping in meals that are low calories, high protein and carbs at certain amounts (e.g. 200g carbs to create meal, 4 dishes implies 50g carbs in the dish; you needed to stay around 240g for the day)]
[Considering: There's a suggestion for protein + carbs intake around 15 minutes after exercises; should I build it in here on reminders, etc?]
[Considering: Add in 'relaxed' exercises to use; as in if you have an injury and don't feel like hardcore exercise can do some yoga, perhaps, or small activities?]
[(2) main areas: Upper (arms, shoulders, upper back), Lower (legs, glutes), Core (upper abdominal, lower abdominal, back), Cardio (moving exercises), Flexibility (stretches)]
